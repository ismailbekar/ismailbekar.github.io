title: "About Me"
---

I am a quantitative researcher and data scientist with a background in environmental systems I currently work at the Technical University of Munich where I use statistical and machine-learning methods to analyze large datasets and understand complex environmental processes related to wildfire, climate and land use and land cover.

I completed my PhD at ETH Zurich where I built and evaluated statistical and machine-learning models. Over time, something changed for me: the ecological questions stayed interesting but the part I enjoyed most was how to answer them. I found myself more interested to data, modeling and the challenge of building quantitative tools.

In parallel with my research, I have been involved in scientific communication and outreach, including interviews, podcasts, and public talks. 

Outside of work, I usually reset by running or playing video games.
