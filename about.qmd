title: "About Me"
---

I am a quantitative researcher and data scientist with a background in environmental systems and risk modeling. I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Munich where I develop and evaluate statistical and machine-learning models on large, heterogeneous datasets to understand complex environmental and risk-related processes.

My academic training began at Hacettepe University, where I studied how human activities and climate interact to shape fire regimes in Mediterranean ecosystems. During this time, my focus gradually shifted from the ecological questions themselves to the analytical process behind answering them—working with data, building models to extract meaningful insights from complex systems.

That focus became clearer during my PhD at ETH Zurich. While the research questions were about fire occurrence and burned area, the part of the work I consistently enjoyed most was the process itself: working through the data, deciding how to structure analyses, testing different modeling choices. Over time, it became clear that my strengths are in quantitative reasoning, data processing, and modeling rather than in a single environmental domain.

In parallel with my research, I have been actively involved in scientific communication and outreach, including interviews, podcasts, and public talks. 

Outside of work, I usually reset by running or playing video games.
