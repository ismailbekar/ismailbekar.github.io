title: "About Me"
---

I am İsmail Bekar, an ecologist with a long-standing interest in how and why fires occur. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Munich, where I work with large datasets and modeling approaches to understand complex environmental patterns.

My journey began during my Bachelor’s and Master’s studies at Hacettepe University, where I explored the interactions between human activities, climate and fire regimes in Mediterranean ecosystems. While working on these topics, I found myself increasingly drawn not just to the ecological questions but to the process of analysing data, building models and writing code to answer them.

This interest deepened during my PhD at ETH Zürich, where I focused on modeling fire occurrence and burned area. Working with large, messy datasets and developing modeling workflows helped me realize that what I enjoy most is the analytical side: programming, data processing and turning complex information into something that make sense.

Alongside my research, I took part in scientific communication and media outreach, using interviews, podcasts and public talks to help people better understand wildfire science and environmental change.

Beyond my studies and research, I spent most of my time either playing video games or running.
